# Bike Plus (prototype)

Live demo: https://bikeplus.netlify.app/

BikePlus is the hub for bike lovers. Share your favorite routes, swap gear recommendations, organize group rides, and buy/sell bike accessories.

## Notes

- The app simulates data fetching from a remote server using a custom hook called `useFetchMockData`. It is a simple timeout function that returns static JSON data.
- There is no data persistence; refreshing the page should reset the data.
- As this is merely a prototype app, most of the functions do not operate as expected for regular usage.

## Prerequisites

To ensure compatibility, please follow these steps:

1. Use Node.js version 18:

```
nvm use
```

2. Install `pnpm` as the package manager:

```
npm install -g pnpm
```

## Getting Started

1. Install project dependencies:

```
